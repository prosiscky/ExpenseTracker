A public GitHub repository for your project.
A Google Slides presentation including:
A brief description of the project and your team.
A breakdown of the architecture and the technologies or third-party services used.
A report of your developments, highlighting your successes, challenges, areas for improvement, lessons learned, and next steps for your project.
A conclusion summarizing your experience.
Remember, the presentation is a vital part of your project completion, so be sure to include it in your planning to avoid any delays in submission.

#### Video Demo of your project

Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 3 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This could take the form of a user walkthrough.

We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, not a strict template, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.


A few points to consider while preparing your video:

Maximum Video Duration: The video should not exceed 3 minutes, ensuring it is concise and engaging.

Background Music: If you include background music, ensure it’s copyright-free to avoid potential legal issues.

Voice-Overs: Feel free to use your voice to guide us through your project. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.

Recommended Tools: We suggest using

Recording: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
Editing tools such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
How to share: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. Make sure your video is accessible to the public - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private”
Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.

So, let’s see your creativity in action.

We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.

Happy building.
